# Game-of-life-8x8-arduino-matrix
this is a game of life project on an 8x8 led matrix, using arduino uno

# Inspiration
this small project was inspired and derives from SAnwandter1 project "Programming 8x8 LED Matrix" 
here is the link to his project : https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SAnwandter1/programming-8x8-led-matrix-23475a?ref=user&ref_id=157202&offset=1 
some credit goes to him for initiating me at the art of controlling an 8x8 led matrix ^^
